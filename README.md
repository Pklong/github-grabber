# Github-Grabber

This project will provide an introduction to Node through several of its popular modules. 
We'll use Node's [path], [fs], [http], as well as the third-party [request] to build an application that fetches a user's repos and writes them to a file.

[path]: https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path
[fs]: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system
[http]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http
[request]: https://github.com/request/request
